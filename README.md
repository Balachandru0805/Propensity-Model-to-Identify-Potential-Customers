# Propensity Model to Identify Potential Customers

Propensity modeling is a method that aims to forecast the chance that individuals, leads, and customers will engage in specific actions. This method uses statistical analysis which takes into account all the independent and confounding factors that impact customer behavior. Suppose you are working for a company as a Data Scientist. Your company is commissioned by an insurance company to develop a tool to optimize their marketing efforts. This project is aimed at building a propensity model to identify potential customers.


## Data Source Information
The insurance company has provided you with a historical data set (train.csv). The company has also provided you with a list of potential customers to whom to market (test.csv). From this list of potential customers, you need to determine yes/no whether you wish to market to them.

- custAge - The age of the customer.
- prefession - Type of job.
- marital - Marital status.
- schooling - Education level.
- default - Has a previous defaulted account.
- housing - Has a housing loan.
- loan - Has a personl loan.
- contact - Preferred contact type.
- month - Last contact month
- day_of_week - Last contact day of the week.
- campaign - Number of times the customer was contacted.
- pdays - Number of days that passed after the client was last contacted.
- previous - Number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client.
- poutcome - Outcome of the previous marketing campaign.
- emp.var.rate - Employment variation rate - quarterly indicater.
- cons.price.id - Consumer price index - monthly indicator.
- cons.conf.idx - Consumer confidence index - monthly indicator.
- euribor3m - Euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator.
- nr.employed - Number of employees - quarterly indicator.
- pmonths - Number of months that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign.
- pastEmail - Number of previous emails sent to this client.
- **responded (target variable)** - Did the customer respond to the campaign and purchase a policy.

    6. Conclusion

## Machine Learning Models Applied
Since the dataset response variable follows binary classification. I have choosen Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Classifier models for managing complexity of higher number of input features.

- Naive Bayes Classifier - 77% Accuracy
- Support Vector Machine - 87% Accuracy
- Random Forest Classifier - 88% Accuracy

## Usecases
- **Retail and E-commerce:** Predict whether a customer is likely to make a purchase after browsing a website or engaging with a marketing campaign.
- **Banking and Finance:** Predict whether a customer is likely to purchase investment products like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds based on their financial behavior.
- **Telecommunications:** Identify customers who are likely to adopt new telecom services like streaming or additional data plans.
- **Healthcare:** Predict whether a patient is likely to schedule an appointment or follow through with a recommended procedure.

## Conclusion
Completed the Exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, balancing the data and applied various Machine Learning models of Naive Bayes (77% accuracy), Support Vector Machine (87% accuracy) and Random Forest Classifier (89% accuracy). Used the best Random Forest model to get the result of test dataset.
