# Propensity Model to Identify Potential Customers

Propensity modeling is a method that aims to forecast the chance that individuals, leads, and customers will engage in specific actions. This method uses statistical analysis which takes into account all the independent and confounding factors that impact customer behavior. Suppose you are working for a company as a Data Scientist. Your company is commissioned by an insurance company to develop a tool to optimize their marketing efforts. This project is aimed at building a propensity model to identify potential customers.
